							<p>Every year accidental fires causes great damage to buildings all around the world. Material damage worth billions of dollars are lost anually due to fire wreckage. Although the material damages caused by fires and the prevention work itself is indeed mind buggling. Nevertheless the worst fires are those in which lives are lost. Losing a signfiicant other, a family member or a friend in a fire is a great tragedy that more people could be without - this is a tragedy that could happen to anyone.
								</p>
								<p>The job of a firefighter is not only to fight fires, but to also to save lives - in which is a very dangerous and diffucult task. The firefighters wear a lot of equipment to cope with the dangeruous situation in the best manner possible. The firefighters that enter the building primarily wear equipements like SCBA (Self Contanined Brething Apparatus), hand held tools and ropes to be able to guide around inside a building filled with smoke in the safest way possible. However they do not have equipment that will help them spot people within the building. Without any clear vision the firefighters will have a hard time to locate where trapped people may be. Nowadays the common way for fire fighters to localise people in a fire is to guide themselves around in the building and search. This is not a good solution on how to find fire victims in a prompt manner.</p>

							<img src="images/motionSensor.jpg" alt="Motion sensor triangulation example">
							<p>Our solution is to install sensors inside public buildings and firms that will work as an assisting system for the firefighters in the case of a fire. The sensors in which the system will utilize are thermo sensors and motion sensors. The motion sensors that will be installed in every room will detect if there are people in the given room. The thermo sensors will be installed around in the construction in a triangular manner and will detect the exact position of the subjects within the surveilled zone by help of triangulation. </p>
							<p>The information collected by the system will thereby be sent to the task leader of the fire truck. The task leader will get the data on a handheld fire truck device that recives information from an external fire department network, which is linked to the given building. The firefighter task leader can then pass the information on to his men. This will help the firefighters to locialise in which rooms there are people and approxiamately where in the room they are - ensuring that the firefighters will approach directly to the subject instead of spending a huge load of time within the burning building locating people. This will reduce the total time it takes to save people and reduce the firefighers exposure to the fire.</p>

							<img src="images/privacySpy.jpg" alt="a projection of lack of privacy">
							<p>The sensors, as far as privacy goes, will not have the ability to trace a person. The motion sensor will only be able to determine if there are people in a room; nothing more. The thermo sensor may solely have the capasity to detect a heated field in the room and will therefore not be able to recognise faces.
Note that the sensors shall not be able to gather information besides the scenario of a fire alarm - neither shall the motion sensors be turned on when the building is safe and sound. This fire assisting system will only be active when the fire alarm is triggered and will otherwise not collect any data from the sensors. The heat sensors themselves will trigger the fire alarm if they detect a large heated area. 

</p><p>The data could in case of a fire or a fire practice be stored for further purposes; such as fire practice by the firefighters and fire practice by the building administratives themselves. The data collcted can be used for instanse to measure the respose time when a fire alarn is triggered and how people leave the edifice. Still no personal or sensitive information will be collected nor stored.</p>
